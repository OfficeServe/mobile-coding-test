## The Product

The product we're building is a **Star Wars Fun Zone**. We want to build a killer application to engage the Star wars lovers with our app.

The application could be either iOS or Android application. Of course it depends of **the role you are applying**.

In order to accomplish this, the product owner has decided the next sprint will include the two user stories below.

## Sprint 1: "May the force be with you"

### User story 1

#### -Description-

As an **end user using the app**  
I want **view a list of the Star Wars films with the most relevant info regarding it**  
So **I know when a film was released, it's title and some key detail representing it**  

- Acceptance criteria:
    1. The user needs to visualize at least the relevant info required in the description.

- Resources:
    - Server side: [Star Wars Films](https://swapi.co/documentation#films)
    - Design: NOT SPECIFIED. Feel free. Don't reinvent the wheel and enjoy.

### User story 2

#### -Description-

As an **end user using the app**  
I want **view a list of people regarding the Star Wars universe**  
So **I would know the name of the character/person and some key detail could represent it**  

- Acceptance criteria:
    1. The user needs to visualize at least the relevant info required in the description.

- Resources:
    - Server side: [Star Wars People](https://swapi.co/documentation#people)
    - Design: NOT SPECIFIED. Feel free. Don't reinvent the wheel and enjoy.


# Technical considerations

- Feel free to use whatever frameworks you consider it's necessary to accomplish your sprint.
- If you may think some explanation is needed, please provide it in the **Retro.md** file explained before.


# Product how to / Considerations to tackle the sprint.

As a product owner I'm not expecting you the best solution. I would rather happy with an solution that works and **gives value to the end user**

It's **not a must** complete the sprint. If you're not able to finish those two stories, please provide a brief of why in the **Retro.md** file.

Any bonus points will be taken in consideration.
